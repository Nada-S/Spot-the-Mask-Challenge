# Spot-the-Mask-Challenge

Prediction of whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask. 
I used different methods : 
1) CNN Baseline Model
2) Data Augmentation
3) Transfer Learning from the following models : 
      - VGG19
      - Resnet152v2	
      - InceptionResNet  	
 
 See the advantages of each model and the results in [the notebook](https://github.com/Nada-S/Spot-the-Mask-Challenge/blob/main/Projet_deep_image_Nada_Staouite.ipynb)
