# Spot-the-Mask-Challenge

Prediction of whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask. 
I used different methods : 
1) CNN Baseline Model
2) Data Augmentation
3) Transfer Learning from the following models : 
      - VGG19
      - Resnet152v2	
      - InceptionResNet	
See the advantages of each model in [the notebook]
